A User Friendly dashboard for the hand gestures 
What is Media Pipe?
Imagine Media Pipe as a handy tool created by Google. It's like a smart assistant for your computer that can understand and analyze what's happening in videos and pictures. It can do some pretty cool things, like recognizing faces, tracking hand movements, identifying objects, and more. The best part is, it's open for everyone to use, and it won't slow down your computer.

What is TensorFlow?
Think of TensorFlow as a powerful software toolkit. It's like a Swiss Army knife for computers, especially when they need to learn and understand things in images and videos. It helps computers get better at recognizing patterns, kind of like how we humans learn from our experiences.

Neural Networks
Neural networks are like the brain cells of a computer. They work together to learn and make sense of things, much like our own brains. These networks are made up of different layers, each with its own role. There's an input layer that takes in information, hidden layers where the real thinking happens, and an output layer that gives us results.

How does it all come together?
mpHands: This is like our detective for finding hands in videos. It's really good at finding hands, even if there are several in the frame. But for our project, we'll make it focus on just one hand.

Hands method: We're basically giving our detective some instructions on how to spot hands in videos.

mp.solutions.drawing_utils: This is like a magic pen that helps us draw dots on the key points of the hand. It saves us from having to draw them ourselves.

load_model function: We're bringing in a pre-trained brain for our computer. This brain already knows about hand gestures.

Gesture.names file: It's like a list of hand gestures we want the computer to recognize. We'll read this list and use it later.

Video Capture object: This is how we turn on your computer's camera.

cap.read(): We keep taking pictures (frames) from the camera, one after the other.

cv2.flip(): We make sure the pictures are displayed the right way on the screen.

cv2.imshow(): We show these pictures on your computer screen, like a live video feed.

cv2.waitKey(): The computer keeps showing these pictures until you press the 'q' key to quit.

In simple terms, we're using some clever tools to make your computer recognize hand gestures in real-time using your webcam. The results are displayed on your screen until you decide to stop by pressing the 'q' key. This technology can be used for all sorts of cool things, like controlling games, communicating through sign language, or even making music!
